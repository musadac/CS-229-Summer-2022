\begin{answer}
\\ \\
a) As the sum of 2 positive semi-definitive matrixes is a positive semi-definite matrix This implies \\ \\
\tab[2cm]$\forall z z^TKz=z^TK_1z+^TK_2z  \geq 0$ \\ \\
So it is a Kernel. \\ \\
b) Counterexample is that $2K_1=K_2$ \\ \\
\tab Then we have $\forall z z^TKz=z^TK_1z-^T2K_1z  \leq 0$\\ \\
So this is a invalid Kernel \\ \\
c) As $K_1$ denotes the kernel matrix generated by kernel $K_1(.) which is PSD. This implies$ \\ \\
\tab  $\forall z z^T K z  \geq 0 $ \\ \\ 
\tab  $\forall z az^T K z  \geq 0 $ \\ \\ 
So it is a Kernel. \\ \\
d) If a = 1 Then we have \\ \\
\tab $-az^TK_1z \leq 0$\\ \\
\tab $z^TK_1z \leq 0$\\ \\
So it is a Kernel\\ \\
e) $K_1$ and $K_2$ are Kernals. \\ \\
\tab $K_1(x,z) = \sum_i\phi_i^1x\phi_i^1z$ \\ \\
\tab $K_1(x,z) = \sum_j\phi_j^2x\phi_j^2z$ \\ \\
\tab $K(x,z) = \sum_i\phi_i^1x\phi_i^1z \sum_j\phi_j^2x\phi_j^2z$ \\ \\
\tab[2cm] $ = \sum_i\sum_j \phi_i^1x\phi_i^1z \phi_j^2x\phi_j^2z$ \\ \\
For Feature Mapping on $\phi_3(x^i)$ We can say is that \\ \\
\tab[2cm] $ = \sum_{i,j}\phi_3,(i,j)(x^i))\phi_3,(i,j)(z^i))$ \\ \\
\tab[2cm] $ = (\phi_3(i,j)(x^i),\phi_3(i,j)(z^i))$ \\ \\
Kernel Matrix is generated using mapping of $\phi_3$ so it is a valid kernel \\ \\
f) As f(x) is a scalar. So $\phi(x)=f(x)$\\ \\
\tab $K(x,z)=\phi(x)^T\phi(z)$ \\ \\
As The Kernel Generated PSD Matrix so it is a Valid Kernel \\ \\
g) The Matrix Obtained from  K3 for any set that is finite is positive semidefinite and so all psd for the sets ${\phi(x^1) ... \phi(x^n)}$. As it is PSD so This is a Kernel. \\ \\
h) By 1(c) Constant and 1(e) The Power we come to know that polynomial of a Kernel will also will be a Kernel as Polynomial Generates constants and Powers of K1. so it is a Kernel
